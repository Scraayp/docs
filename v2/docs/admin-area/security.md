## Firewall

The integrated **Firewall** in **CloudPanel** is  based on [UFW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncomplicated_Firewall), also known as **Uncomplicated Firewall**. <br />
Developed to ease iptables firewall configuration, **ufw** provides a user-friendly way to create an IPv4 or IPv6 host-based firewall.

**CloudPanel** is being shipped with pre-configured rules to achieve higher security.

:::warning Recommendation
For higher security, whitelist the **SSH Port (22)** for your IPs only. The **CloudPanel Port (8443)** should only be whitelisted if you have a static ip.
